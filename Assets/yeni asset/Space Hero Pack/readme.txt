_1. WHAT IS IT
This is Space Hero Pack. Created specially for Unity3D.
Package contains 2D character sprites for your game.
There are 3 classes of characters with 4 colors on your choice (red,blue,gren,grey) with 3 different types of weapon.
All sprites are 512x512.

_2. HOW TO USE IT
Because of high amount of sprites I can't make spritesheets of all. You can use a tool like TexturePackerGUI or use online sprite maker like https://draeton.github.io/stitches/ for sprites you liked.
Sorry for this.

_3.ANIMATIONS
Numbering animations for sprites. It's pretty the same for every folder contain sprites.
